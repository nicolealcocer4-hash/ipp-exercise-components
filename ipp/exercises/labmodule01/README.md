# Programming in Python - An Introduction: Lab Module 01

### Description

Briefly describe the objectives of the Lab Module:

1) Configure the local development environment for Python using VS Code.

2) Understand how to use built-in Python modules to retrieve system information.

3) Execute Python modules from the IDE and command line to validate setup.



### Exercise Activities

List the actions you took in implementing the Lab Module:

1) Created a Python module to test the platform module and retrieve system and machine information.

2) Created a Python module to test the sys module and retrieve Python version data.

3) Executed both modules to verify correct output and environment configuration.

### Unit and/or Integration Tests Executed

List the tests you exercised in validating your functionality for the Lab Module:

1) Ran each module directly from VS Code using the Python interpreter.

2) Verified output matched expected system and Python version information.
