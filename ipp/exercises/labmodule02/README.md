# Programming in Python - An Introduction: Lab Module 02

### Description

Briefly describe the objectives of the Lab Module:

1) Practice basic Python data types including integers, floats, strings, and booleans.

2) Learn how to use arithmetic operators, string formatting, and type conversion.

3) Understand iteration using for-loops with sequences such as lists, tuples, and ranges.


### Exercise Activities

List the actions you took in implementing the Lab Module:

1) Created Python modules to perform numeric calculations, string operations, and boolean comparisons.

2) Implemented for-loops to iterate over strings, lists, tuples, and ranges.

3) Printed formatted output to validate loop behavior and calculations.


### Unit and/or Integration Tests Executed

List the tests you exercised in validating your functionality for the Lab Module:

1) Executed each module from the command line using the Python interpreter.

2) Verified output matched expected results discussed in class and provided examples.
